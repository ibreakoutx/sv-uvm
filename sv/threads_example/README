		Title: 		THREADS
		
		Objective: 	To demonstrate launching multiple threads 
		Description:  	This is an example of using threads. It shows the use of fork-join, join_any and  join_none
		Additional setup: None	

To run the design:

Using Makefile :
	comp_join_none       -- It compiles the design to run for join_none
	run_joine_none       -- It runs the design to run for join_none
	comp_join  	     -- It compiles the design to run for join	
	run_join	     -- It runs the design to run for join
	comp_join_any        -- It compiles the design to run for join_any
	run_join_any         -- It runs the design to run for join_any 	
	clean 	     	     -- Cleans up the log files and previous run executables.
	join		     -- It executes comp_join and run_join targets	
	join_any	     -- It executes comp_any and run_any targets
	join_none	     -- It executes comp_none and run_none targets
	all 	             -- It does all the above steps.		

Using shell scripts:
	comp_join_none.csh   -- It compiles the design to run for join_none
	run_joine_none.csh   -- It runs the design to run for join_none
	comp_join.csh  	     -- It compiles the design to run for join	
	run_join.csh	     -- It runs the design to run for join
	comp_join_any.csh    -- It compiles the design to run for join_any
	run_join_any.csh     -- It runs the design to run for join_any 	
	clean.csh 	     -- Clean up the log files and previous run executables.
