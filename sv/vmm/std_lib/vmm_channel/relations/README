		Title:    Usage of vmm_channel APIs to query/setup channel relationships
 
		Objective: 	Demonstrate how to dynamically setup producers and consumers for the channel implemented Transaction level Interfaces  and query for the appropriate interfaces
		Description: 	
		The set_consumer and set_producer methods are used to dynmaically connect transcators and generators to the channels. This example also shows how the get_consumer/get_producer methods are used to verify the the transactions flow in an appropiate manner

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
