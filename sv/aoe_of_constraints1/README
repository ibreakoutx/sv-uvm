		Title: 		Aspect Extension (AOE) of Constraint
 
		Objective: 	To Demonstrate how to use Aspect Extension inside a Constraint block to modify the constraints.
		Description: The included example performs an aspect extension of the class Transaction.
					The Transaction class is extended in-place, meaning the original definition is modified to include the additional constraint block.  The testcase can be run with and with/out the extension
					Run the testcase with the original definition of Transaction (no aspects), just run "make"
					Run the testcase with the inclusion of the aspect extension of Transaction (Note: the change in randomized values addr and data) just run "make aspect".
					Usage notes:  The class Transaction is at the $root scope.  As such the test is compiled with the '+ntb_opts dtm' option.  The aspect is also at the $root scope (aspect extension must be at the same scope as the class). 

		Additional setup: None	

Using Makefile:
        clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp            -- To compile the design in native mode.
        run             -- To run the design for the compiled one with native mode.
        aspect_comp     -- To compile with aspect
        aspect_run     -- To run the test for the compiled design with aspect
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh          -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh           -- To compile the design in native mode.
        run.csh            -- To run the design  for the compiled one with native mode.
        aspect_comp.csh    -- To compile with aspect
        aspect_run.csh     -- To run the test for the compiled design with aspect
