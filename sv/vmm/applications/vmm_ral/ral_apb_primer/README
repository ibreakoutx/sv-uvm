		Title:   RAL APB Primer example
		Objective: This designe example is designed to learn how to create a RAL model of the registers and memories in a design, how to integrate this model in a verification environment and how to verify the implementation of those registers and memories using the predefined tests. It will also show how the RAL model can be used to model the configuration and DUT driver code so it can be reusable in a system-level environment. Finally, it shows how the RAL model is used to implement additional functional tests.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	bit_bash        -- To compile & run the bit bash design
       	hw_reset        -- To compile & run the hw_reset design
       	mem_walk        -- To compile & run the mem_walk design
       	mem_access      -- To compile & run the mem_access design
       	gen_html        -- To compile & run the gen_html design
       	user_test       -- To compile & run the user_test design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.


     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp1.csh        -- To compile the bit_bash design
        run1.csh         -- To run the bit_bash design  
        comp2.csh        -- To compile the hw_rest design
        run2.csh         -- To run the hw_reset design  
        comp3.csh        -- To compile the mem_acccess design
        run3.csh         -- To run the mem_access design  
        comp4.csh        -- To compile the mem_walk design
        run4.csh         -- To run the mem_walk design  
        comp5.csh        -- To compile the gen_html design
        run5.csh         -- To run the gen_html design  
        comp6.csh        -- To compile the user_test design
        run6.csh         -- To run the user_test design
