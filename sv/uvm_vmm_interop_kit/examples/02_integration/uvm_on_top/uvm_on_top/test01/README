		Title:  UVM on top   
 
		Objective: This example demonstrates a UVM-on-top environment, where UVM controls test flow phasing.

		Description:   Unlike the VMM-on-top use  model, VMM envs integrated in an UVM environment do not require modification,  i.e. do not require a change to its inheritance and the addition of a call to <uvm_build> in the ~build~ phase.


	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
