		Title:    Usage of vmm_opts for passing runtime options to the verification environment	
 
		Objective: 	Demonstrate how to leverage the vmm_opts class which provides an interface to define and access runtime options. Runtime options can be specified using a combination of command-line arguments and option files specified using a plus-separated list of filenames. 
		Description: 	
		VMM provides capability to specify runtime options which help in preventing recompilations and enable control of sequencing through the command line using the vmm_opts class. Options of type integer, string and bit can be specified from the command line. Depending on the requirement, user can specify any or all of these different types.

		A sample usage is:

		        simv +vmm_opts+NUM_TRANS=10 +vmm_opts+MODE=RECORD +vmm_opts_file+<file_name>
				where the content fo the file can be:
			 %cat file_name
			             +MODE=RECORD
						 +SCB_MODE

				These options, NUM_TRANS and MODE, can be captured in the testbench through the methods available in vmm_opts class. The vmm_opts class provides a set of static methods that support bit, int and string type runtime arguments. A  built-in help method prints out the details of the available options. Available vmm_opts methods are: 
				        vmm_opts::get_string("Option Name", "Default","Help for the option"); 
						vmm_opts::get_bit("Option Name", "Help for the option"); 
						vmm_opts::get_int("Option Name" , -1 , "Help for the option");

				

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
