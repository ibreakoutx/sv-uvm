		Title: 	Complex types using Clocking Blocks	 
 
		Objective:  Learning Complex types using Clocking Blocks

		Description:
		Fixed array with multiple dimensions
                Fixed array of unpacked structures
                Fixed array of packed structures
                Multiple dimensions of  packed array
                Limitations 
                Queues, Dynamic arrays (strings) as well associative arrays not supported
                Expressions involving streaming, Function call returns,  unpacked array  concatenation

		
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
