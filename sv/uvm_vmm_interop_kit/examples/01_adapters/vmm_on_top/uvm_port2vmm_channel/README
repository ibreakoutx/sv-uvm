		Title:    Connecting UVM ports to VMM channels 
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the IK to connect UVM ports to VMM transactors.

		Description:UVM publisher -> VMM consumer - The UVM publisher broadcasts an UVM transaction to the adapter, which is serving as an UVM subscriber.  The adapter converts the transaction to its VMM counterpart and sneaks it into the VMM consumerâ€™s input channel.  In this case the adapter is serving as the VMM publisher. 
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
