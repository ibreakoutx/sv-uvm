   Title:     RAL example with implicit phasing
 
Objective:    Demonstrate implicit phase methodology for RAL.

Description:   This test has :
               - tb_env extended from vmm_groups (and not vmm_ral_env)
               - instantiate vmm_ral_access explicitly in top-level env (extended from vmm_group) 
               - test class extended from vmm_test
               - frontdoor write/read access to registers
																	
Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
