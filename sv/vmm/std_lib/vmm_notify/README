		Title:    Usage of vmm_notify	
 
		Objective: 	To demonstrate how to implement an interface to the notification service a synchronization mechanism for concurrent threads or transactors. 
		Description: 	
		This specific example shows how to set up a ON_OFF notification using :
		(ntfy.configure(ID, vmm_notify::ON_OFF )
		Once configured, the user can check whether the notification is ON or OFF using the is_on() method. As forsk are being spawned out, the user can wait on the notification using the 'waif_for' methdod wherale a parallel thread can unblock the former by triggering the notification through the 'indicate' method.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
