		Title:    Mixed Hierarchy
 
		Objective: 	This example demonstrates how testbench environments can evolve to become mixed component hierarchies, where UVM instantiates VMM that instantiates UVM and so on.

		Description: The detailed description is in test.sv
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
