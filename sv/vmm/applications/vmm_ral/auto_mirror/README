Title:        RAL Auto-Mirror updated (Direct Update & Passive Update)

Objective:    Demonstrate the Direct Update and Passive Update mehcanisms of RAL Auto-Mirror 
              update feature.

Description:  Dut with 3, 8-bit registers.
              1. REG1   : 1 8-bit field, R/W access with Auto-mirror ON.(by default this capability is ON)
              2. REG2   : 1 8-bit field, R/W access with Auto-mirror OFF.
              3. REG3   : 2 4-bit fields, 
                         cnt1 : R/W access with Auto-mirror ON.
                         cnt2 : DC access with Auto-mirror OFF.
              
              REG2 is updated by "write()" method which directly talks to the physical interface( non-RAL).
              And the mirror value for the same is updated by Passive Update mechanism. This is implemented
              by overloading 'observe_single()'. 'tb_mon' provides the details of the observed transactions
              to this 'observe_single()'.
              
              REG1 and REG3.cnt1 are updated by the DUT itself. The mirror value for the same is updated by 
              Direct Update mechanism which is auto-generated and kicked off by the ralgen when used with 
              command line options '-auto_mirror' or '-a' along with '-b'. This mechanism is implemented as
              part of backdoor access mechanism hence '-b' is must.
              
              REG1 and REG3 can be updated by PASSIVE mechanism also, but REG2 will never be updated by DIRECT
              update mechanism( as it is turned off in the RALF description).

Additional setup: None	

To run the example:
Using Makefile:
clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
comp            -- To compile the design
run             -- To run the design
all             -- It does all the above steps.
Using shell scripts:
clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
comp.csh        -- To compile the design
run.csh         -- To run the design
