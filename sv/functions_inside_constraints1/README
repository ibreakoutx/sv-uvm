Technical content:
		Title: 	      functions inside constraints
		
		Objective:    To Demonstrate usage of functions inside constraints

		Description: 	This shows an example of calling functions inside constraints.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.

     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
