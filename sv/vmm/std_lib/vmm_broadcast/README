		Title:   Point to multi-point communication mechanism with vmm_broadcast 
 
		Objective: 	Demonstrate how to use the vmm_brodcast base class to  ensure that multiple individual o/p channle recives the same copy of the transmitted transaction generated by a single broadcast source
	 	Description: 	
	'bcast' is an instance of the vmm_broadcast base class.. Transactions are fed into its input_channel and multiple o/p channels are created through the new_ouptut functionality of the vmm_broadcast base class. Broadcasting has differetnt modes (ALAP and AFAP).. Depending on when the o/p channles are empty, packets are braodcasted to them. This exampl shows how the braodcasting happens in different scenarios when specific o/p channels connected to vmm_broadcast has different fill levels.

 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
