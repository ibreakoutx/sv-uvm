		Title:    Connecting VMM notifier consumer and a UVM passive producer
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the IK to connect a UVM passive producer to VMM notifier consumer through the <avt_notify2analysis> adapter

		Description:  This example uses an avt_notify2analysis and an avt_uvm_tlm2channel adapter to connect a vmm_notifier_consumer and an uvm_passive_producer. The uvm_passive_producer gets notifier through  avt_notify2analysis, then puts response on avt_uvm_tlm2channel back to consumer


	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
