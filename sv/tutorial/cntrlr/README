Please follow the steps below to do this section of the lab:

step1:  cd test/
step2:  create cntrlr_test.v which will do the following tasks. 
        1) resetSequence() and resetCheck(): asserting and checking reset
        2) readOP() and writeOP(): to drive read and write operations on the system bus according to the timing diagram given for the controller.
        3) define virtual port for SRAM device and bind the port to device0..device3 by using the appropriate interface signals
        4) checkSramWrite() and checkSramRead(): To verify sram write/read on a particular device meets the timing
        5) checkSimpleReadWrite() and checlAllAddresses():  To perform read, write and check sequeuences using the above built funcions.
           
step3:  compile and run the simulation
To see the solution implemented using SystemVerilog for TestBench go to 
1) ./solution 
2) Run the testcase:
Using shell scripts:
		clean.csh   	-- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run	
 		comp.csh 	-- To compile the design.
		run.csh 	-- To run the design 
Using Makefile:
		clean   	-- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run	
 		comp 		-- To compile the design.
		run 		-- To run the design. 
 
Thank You!!
