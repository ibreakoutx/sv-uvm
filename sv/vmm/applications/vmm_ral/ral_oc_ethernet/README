		          Title:      Developing VMM-compliant reusable and flexible components for the networking domain
				   
				  Objective:   The example is used to illustrate how to use the VMM Register Abstraction Layer application package is used for register validation of complex designs
				  Description:
		The OpenCore Ethernet Media Access Controller (MAC) has the Wishbone interfacei and the RAL abstarction Model uses the Wishbone Master BFM to access and update the resgiters in the actual designs.
		The oc_ethernet.ral has the description of the registers and memories in the design as specified in the RALF format. 'ralgen' takes in this file and generates the ral_oc_ethernet.sv file which has the RAL model of the DUT registers and memories. The wb_ral_master in the tb_env.sv file instantiates the Wishbon master BFM and transalates the generic RAL transactions into Wisbone transactions. 
	    Once the ral_model and the RAL RW xator is instantiated and registerd in the Verification environment,users can directly use the pre0defined tests that ships with VCS like the bit_bash and hw_reset tests to do automated verification of the regsiters and memories. Users can write their own tests to test specifif register/memory functionality they are interested in.

   Additional Setup: None

   To run the example:
         Using Makefile:
		         clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
				 hw_reset        -- To compile and run the hw_reset test
				 bit_bash        -- To compile  and run the bit_bash test
				 reg_access      -- To compile and run the reg_access test
				 mem_walk        -- To compile and run the mem_walk test
				 all             -- To compile and run all the tests
				 
		Using shell scripts:
		        clean.csh                -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
				comp_hw_reset.csh        -- To compile the hw_reset test
				comp_bit_bash.csh        -- To compile  the bit_bash test
				comp_reg_access.csh      -- To compile the reg_access test
				comp_mem_walk.csh        -- To compile the mem_walk test
				run.csh                  -- run the tests
