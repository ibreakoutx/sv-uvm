		Title:    Procedural scenarios using VMM scenario generator	
 
		Objective: 	 demonstrate how to implemnet procedural and hierarchical scenarios using VMM scenarios and scenario generator	

		Decription: 
		The "apply" method in the VMM scenario generator gives thr procedural interface to the user of creating procedural and hierarchical scenarios. In the example, the simple_seq_lib has a small set of basic scenarios. All that the user needs to do  to create a hierarchical scenarios using these base level scenario is to override the virtual task apply of the top scenario class and call the apply lastk of the base scenarios within thta without the need to invoke any macros or other complicated procedure. Here the "apply' task of "simple_seq_sub_seqs" is extended to call the "apply" methods of the lower level scenarios

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
