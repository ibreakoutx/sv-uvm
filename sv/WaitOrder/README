		Objective:  Learning Event Sequencing (wait_order) 

		Description:  
		Suspends calling process until all event triggered in specified order
                Preceding event not restricted to occur once
                out of order triggering causes runtime error if else action block is missing

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
