		Title:  VMM on top   
 
		Objective: This example demonstrates a VMM-on-top environment, where the vmm_env controls test flow phasing.

		Description:  The VMM use model is fully preserved, including  user-controlled step-by-step phasing via direct calls to the ~vmm_env~ phase methods. 
Class- vmm_env_with_uvm
 A vmm_env that contains an UVM child; shows when each UVM and VMM phase is  executed relative to each other.

	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
