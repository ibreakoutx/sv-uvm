		Title:    	Developing VMM based verification environmentt for ALU verification
 
		Objective: 	 To explain how to quickly setup a verification environment efficiently for an ALU using VMM1.1 components
		Description: The verification environment consists of the transaction class easily created using the VMM shorthand macros, the ALU configuration descriptor class, coverage class for tracking different kind of transactions,	the Transaction level interfaces created through vmm_channle, atomic generators, the driver components extended from vmm_xactor, the monitor, env and asociated classes

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
