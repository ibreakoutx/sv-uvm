		Title:  Writing Command layer Monitor Xactors  
 
		Objective: 	This example is designed to learn how to write VMM-compliant command-lever monitorstransactors that observe pin wiggling on one side and report the observed transactions on a transaction-level interface on the other side.
		Description: Please refer to the VMM Primer: "Writing Command-Layer Monitors" in the $VCS_HOME/doc/UserGuide area

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
