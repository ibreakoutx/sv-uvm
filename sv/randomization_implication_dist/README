Technical content:
		Title: 			RANDOMIZATION
		
		Objective: 		To demonstrate randomization & an implication operator and dist constraint
		Description: 	 	This is a simple example shows the use of a default constraint and the use of implication operator to define address ranges and shows the use of the "dist" constraint to define address ranges
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
