		Title:    Connecting UVM components to VMM consumers through the vmm_channel_adapter
 
		Objective: 	This example uses an <vmm_channel_adapter> to connect an UVM producer  (generator) to a VMM consumer (driver). 

		Description: UVM producer -> VMM consumer - The UVM producer connects to the Adapter's blocking transport export and the adpater is then connected to the VMM consumer
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
