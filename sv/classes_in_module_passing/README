		Objective: 		To demonstrate passing data via shared mailbox
		Description: 		This is an exmaple of a program generating data and passing it to a module via a shared mailbox . It is also possible for a module to send data to a Testbench. This can be interesting for modeling applications,  sending backdoor trasnaction data from various modules or tb programs to other modules or tb programs
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
