Technical content:
		Title: 		CLASSES IN MODULE
		
		Objective:	To demonstrate how to use classes in programs and modules
		Description: 	This is an example of using an associative array. Associative arrays are great for not having to specifiy size of arrays up front; and also to model hashes or memories.
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
