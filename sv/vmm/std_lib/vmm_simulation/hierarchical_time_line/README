		Title: 		Test for phases coordination in hierarchical timelines
 
		Objective:    Demonstrates phasing coordination between timelines running under parent/child relationship

		Description:   This test shows the  phase coordination between timelines running under parent/child relationship. 

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
