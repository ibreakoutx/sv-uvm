		Title:    Connecting VMM xactors to UVM components with analysis ports and exports
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the <vmm_analysis_adapter> to connect VMM xactors to UVM components with analysis ports and exports.


		Description: 
Two modes of connection are possible.
 - UVM publisher -> VMM consumer - 
   The UVM publisher broadcasts an UVM transaction to the adapter, which is    serving as an UVM subscriber. The adapter converts the transaction    to its VMM counterpart and sneaks it into the VMM consumer's input channel.

 - VMM generator -> UVM subscriber -
   The VMM generator puts VMM transactions into its output channel. The    adapter, having a handle to the same channel, continually gets transactions,    converts them to their UVM counterpart, and broadcasts them to all UVM    subscribers. In this case, the adapter is serving as the UVM publisher.

	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
