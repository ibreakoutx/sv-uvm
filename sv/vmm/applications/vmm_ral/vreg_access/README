		Title: 		 Virtual Register Access 
 
		Objective:    Demonstrate frontdoor and backdoor access to virtual registers and virtual fields.

		Description:   This test demonstrates :
		               - write/read virtual registers( frontdoor access)
																	- poke/peek virtual registers( backdoor access)
																	- poke/peek virtual fields
																	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
