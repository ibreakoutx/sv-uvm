		Title:    	Developing VMM1.1-compliant verification environment f with multiple CPU's
 
		Objective: 	To explain how to efficiently coordinate two CPU transaction generation
		Description: 	The design being used consists of a memory system that is accessed by two CPUs. There is a common system bus that allows the CPUs access to the memory through a controller, and an arbiter decides which CPU gets control of the system bus.The verification environment is the CPU's. Each CPU subenv contains a driver and a generator. The CPU scenarios are controlled by a multi stream scenario generator which is a top level generator.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
