Please follow the steps below to do this section of the lab
step1:  cd test/
step2:  create arb_test.v which will do the following tasks. 
        1) reset_test: asserting and checking reset
        2) drive_test1: driving request and checking grant for CPU0
        3) drive_test2: driving request and checking grant for CPU1 
        4) drive_test3: driving request and checking grant for both CPU0 and CPU1 
step3:  compile and run the simulation



To verify the arbiter using VCS, please do the 
following:
1. Open the file "setup" to set paths and environment variables.
2. Run the script "run.csh".
