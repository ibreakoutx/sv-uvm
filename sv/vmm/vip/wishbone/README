		Title:    	Developing VMM-compliant Wishbone VIP 
 
		Objective:  How to create powerful, CDV based architectures for VIP for configurable Interconnect architectures	
		Description:

The WISHBONE1 System-on-Chip (SoC) Interconnection Architecture for Portable IP Cores is a flexible design methodology for use with semiconductor IP cores. Its purpose is to foster design reuse by alleviating System-on-Chip integration problems. This is accomplished by creating a common interface between IP cores. This improves the portability and reliability of the system,and results in faster time-to-market for the end user.
The VIP components consits of Master, slave, callabcks, transaction class, and associated configuration decsription componets. These can be easily created from scartch by using the vmmgen utility.

	config.sv		Configuration Descriptor
	cycle.sv		Transaction Descriptor
	master.sv		Master Transactor
	master_chk.sv		Master Protocol Checker
	slave.sv		Slave Transactor
	slave_chk.sv		Slave Protocol Checker

 The example test has the following structure:

 100 read & write <-> Wishbone <-> Wishbone  <-> Wishbone ->   RAM
                       Master      Interface      Slave   <- Response


		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
