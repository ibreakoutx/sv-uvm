		Title: 		Test for phasing of multiple vmm_test  
 
		Objective:    Demonstrates phasing execution for multiple vmm_test timelines

		Description:  This tests shows the usage of multiple vmm_test  in VMM environment.  Runtime option +vmm_test can be used to run all(ALL_TESTS) test or selective tests (<test_name>).

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
