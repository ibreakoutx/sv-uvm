		Title:    Connecting VMM notifications to UVM components with analysis ports and exports
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the IK to connect VMM xactors notifications  to UVM components with analysis ports and exports.

		Description: VMM publisher -> UVM observer - The VMM publisher broadcasts a VMM transaction to the adapter, which is serving as a VMM subscriber.  The adapter converts the transaction to its UVM counterpart and broadcasts it to the UVM observerâ€™s analysis export.  . In this case, the adapter is serving as the UVM publisher.
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
