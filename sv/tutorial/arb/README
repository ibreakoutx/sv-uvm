Please follow the steps below to do this section of the lab

step1:  cd test/

step2:  create arb_test.v which will do the following tasks. 
        1) reset_test: asserting and checking reset
        2) drive_test1: driving request and checking grant for CPU0
        3) drive_test2: driving request and checking grant for CPU1 
        4) drive_test3: driving request and checking grant for both CPU0 and CPU1 
step3:  compile and run the simulation
To verify the arbiter using VCS, please do the following:
1) cd solution
2)  Run the testcase:
	
Using shell scripts:
		clean.csh   	-- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run	
 		comp.csh 	-- To compile the design.
		run.csh 	-- To run the design 
Using Makefile:
		clean   	-- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run	
 		comp 		-- To compile the design.
		run 		-- To run the design. 
Thank You!!
