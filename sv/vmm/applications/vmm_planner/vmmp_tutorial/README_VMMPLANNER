The plans are under the dir ./memsys/plans

Right now we are supporting ms-excel and ms-word flow

To understand the dir structure and dut please read the below files 
./memsys/plans/memsys_wordplan.xml (these are wordplans in the future)
./memsys/plans/sram_wordplan.xml
Please open the above files using ms-word or openoffice2.0

The plans(./memsys/plans) dir has a block level plan sram_plan.xml 
and a master plan memsys_plan.xml 
These files can be opened using ms-excel or openoffice2.0.

There is a Makefile under ./memsys/solution
so cd to ./memsys/solution to run this example.
"gmake" will run the default test(memsys0.v) and creates the annotated plan in the plans dir
To understand what commands are executed, just do "gmake -n". 
If you want to run the other test(memsys1.v) do "gmake test01"

There are annotated version plan files in ./memsys/plans/annotated/.
You may take a look at those files to get idea how they look like without running VMM Planner examples.
