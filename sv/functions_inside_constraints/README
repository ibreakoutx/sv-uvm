		Title: 			Functions Inside Constraints
		
		Objective: 		To demonstrate how functions can be called inside constraints
		Description: 	 	This is a simple example that uses functions inside constraints
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
