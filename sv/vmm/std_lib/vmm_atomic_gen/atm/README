		Title:    	Developing VMM-compliant data models and generator 
 
		Objective: 	 To explain how to develop VMM-compliant data models and generators. 
		Description: 	The data model is a UNI ATM cell.
					The classes defined in the "atm.vr" file implement a set of reusable ATM-related verification components. As such, they do not include DUT-specific functionality or information.
					The programs defined in the "atm.sv" is test to verify the individual ATM verification components.
			  		Verifying data models and generators stand-alone is an excellent way to debug an input coverage model and ensure good quality of results from the generators.	

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
