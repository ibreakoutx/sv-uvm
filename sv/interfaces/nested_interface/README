Technical content:
 Title                : NESTED INTERFACES.
 Objective            : To illustrate nesting of interfaces.
 Description          : A simple example that instantiates a bus interface within a top level interface.
 
 Additional setup     : None	


To run the example:
    Using Makefile
 clean                - To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
 comp                 - To compile the design
 run                  - To run the design
 all                  - It does all the above steps.

    Using shell scripts
 clean.csh            - To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
 comp.csh             - To compile the design
 run.csh              - To run the design	


Additional Notes:
The example consists of the following files.

interface.sv : This file has two interface blocks namely Bus_if and Top_level_if. The Top_level_if instantiates the Bus_if illustrating nested interfaces.

test.sv : Consists of the program block which takes an instance of the top level interface from the top and drives address, data and mode fields which are part of the Bus_if nested in the top level interface.

top.v :	Creates an instance of the test and the interface and connects a clock to it.
