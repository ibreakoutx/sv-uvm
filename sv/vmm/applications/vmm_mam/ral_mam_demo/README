		Title:   Example to show memory modeled in RAL leveraging the MAM capabilities 	
		Objective: 	To show how memory management is achived through RAL and MAM components in the verification environmnet
		Description: Intercation of the MAM component in the sunenv with the physical memory accessed though RAL memory components. This example introduces a vmm_subenv for encapsualting the RAL model and the memory configuration in the RAL primer example ( $VCS_HOME/doc/examples/testbench/sv/vmm/applications/ral_apb_primer) . This then goes on to demonstrate how the configuration passed on from the top level environment can be used to initialize and mange the memory component in the RAL generated model through the MAM property of the abstarcted memory class
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	user_test       -- To compile the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
