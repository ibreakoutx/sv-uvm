		Title:    Writing  Command Layer Master Transactors	
 
		Objective: 	 This example is to help learn how to write VMM-compliant command-lever master transactorstransactors with a transaction-level interface on one side and pin wiggling on the other, also known as bus-functional models (BFM).
		Description: Please refer to the Master Xactor Primer, " Writing Command Layer Master Transactors" in the $VCS_HOME/doc/UserGuide are	

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
