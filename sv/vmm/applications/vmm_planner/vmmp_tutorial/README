This tutorial is intended to give you a very solid hands-on
exposure to the New SystemVerilog for TestBench technology in VCS.
You would need VCS 2005.06 or a later version in order to
be able to run all the simulations in this package.

You need -sverilog compile-time option to compile SystemVerilog program. 

The design being used consists of a memory system that is 
accessed by two CPUs. There is a common system bus that allows 
the CPUs access to the memory through a controller, and an 
arbiter decides which CPU gets control of the system bus.

There are 4 directories at this level: sram, arb, cntrlr and
memsys. Each of these, except sram (sram only contains the 
directory "rtl"), in turn, contains the following 3 directories: 
1. Directory "rtl", containing its relevant Verilog code.
2. Directory "solution", containing the solution testbench, 
   interface, top-level verilog, compile-script and run-script 
   files. To run the simulation under each solution directory, 
   please go into that directory and look in the README there 
   for details.
3. Directory "test", where you will write your own testbench, 
   interface, top-level verilog and other files such as scripts. 

We hope you'll enjoy going through this hands-on tutorial.

Thank you.
