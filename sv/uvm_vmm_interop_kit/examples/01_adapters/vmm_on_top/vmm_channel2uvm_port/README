		Title:    Connecting VMM xactors to UVM componenst with ports and exports
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the IK to connect VMM xactors to UVM components with transport ports and exports.

		Description: VMM publisher -> UVM consumer - The VMM publisher puts a VMM transaction to the adapter, which is serving as a VMM subscriber.  The adapter having a handle to the same channel, converts the transaction to its UVM counterpart and broadcasts it to consumerâ€™s blocking get port.  In this case, the adapter is serving as the UVM publisher.
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
