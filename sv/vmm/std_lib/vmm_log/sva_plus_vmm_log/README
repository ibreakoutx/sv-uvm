                Title:   Using vmm_log with SVA 
                Objective:  To Demonstrate using of vmm_log with SVA
                Description: This examples illustrates the use of vmm_log to capture error/warning message from the assertions.
	
files required : interfaces.v, test_parallel.v, top_p.v  and run_parallel.csh

				Hierarchy:
				top
				 |
				 -- parallel
 			         |
				 --test 

To know how to use vmm_log, check the interfaces.v wherein three steps are given.

 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
        clean           -- To clean up the log files and executables of previous run
        comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executables of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design

                Additional setup: None
