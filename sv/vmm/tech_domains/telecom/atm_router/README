		Title:    	Developing VMM-compliant verification environment for an ATM router
 
		Objective: 	 To explain how to develop VMM-compliant data models, generators and transactors to efficiently and easily create a robust constraint random verification environment for telecom domains. 
		Description: 	The ATM router has multiple/configurable number of i/p and o/p ports. Packets can be transmitted from any input to o/p ports. There are specific charectreistics of the packets and the Recievers have to accordingly identify these packets by decoupling this information. The example shows how multiple driver /receiver VMM componenst can be ceated, and along with the Packet generators simulate different interesting traffic patterns while tracking coverage and ensuring data integrity throughh environment scoreboard components.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
