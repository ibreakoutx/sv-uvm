		Title:    Connecting UVM analysis ports to VMM notifications 
 
		Objective: 	This example shows how to use the IK to connect UVM analysis ports to VMM notifications.

		Description: UVM publisher -> VMM observer - The UVM publisher broadcasts a UVM transaction to the adapter, which is serving as a UVM subscriber.  The adapter converts the transaction to its VMM counterpart and broadcasts it to the VMM observerâ€™s notification callback.  . In this case, the adapter is serving as the VMM publisher
	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
