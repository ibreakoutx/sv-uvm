		Title: 	Model Save and Model  restore	 
 
		Objective: To learn how the  Model Save and Model  restore works

		Description: Model Save and Model restore provides a solution to save the simulation time spent in the reset sequence. Model Save saves the current state of the design at a specified simulation time into a save image file. The specified simulation time is called the reset point. Model restore restores the design to the simulation state saved in the save image file.
		
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
