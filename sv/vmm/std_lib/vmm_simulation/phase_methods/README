		Title: 		VMM_UNIT VMM_TIMELINE methods & phases
 
		Objective:     Usage of various vmm_unit, vmm_timeline methods and phases.

		Description:   This test shows the usage of the timeline phases and the following methods.
		                - get_timeline()
						- get_phase()
						- insert_phase()
						- get_previous_phase()
						- get_next_phase()
						- step_function_phase()
						- run_phase()
						- task_phase_timeout()
						- reset_to_phase()
						- abort_phase()
						- jump_to_phase()

 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
