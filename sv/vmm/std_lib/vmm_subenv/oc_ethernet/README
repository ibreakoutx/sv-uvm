		Title:    	Use of vmm_subenv for Environment composition and reuse from block to system level
 
		Objective: Demonstrate how vmm_subenv and its associated methods can be used to ensure ease of resuse when moving from block level to system level as well as identify and architect reusable sub-environments when you first design and architect a verification environment.

		Description: 	Please refer to the SubEnv primer in the $VCS_HOME/doc/UserGuide area

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
