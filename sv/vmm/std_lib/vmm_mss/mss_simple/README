		Title:    Usage of Multistream scenario generation 
 
		Objective: 	Demonstrate how to use MSS to synchronize multiple streams of generation of different VMM transactions 
		Description: 	
VMM has base classes called vmm_ms_scenario and vmm_ms_scenario_gen for defining multi stream scenarios and executing them. Multi stream scenario allows user to execute scenarios/transactions of different stream with a synchronization among them.
   User has to extend vmm_ms_scenario class and define the execution of transaction/scenario inside the method execute(). This scenario instance is registered to the generator instance of vmm_ms_scenario_gen through register_ms_scenario() method of the generator. Generator randomizes the scenario and calls its execute() method.
   Any number of scenarios can be registered to a multi stream generator. It executes registered scenarios in round robin order by default until stop_after_n_scenarios or stop_after_n_insts limit is reached.
	The example shows basic usage of multi stream scenario where 2 different kinds of transactions are executed concurrenlty. User can change the order of execution accroding to the requirement.(dynamic, reactive, etc).


		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
