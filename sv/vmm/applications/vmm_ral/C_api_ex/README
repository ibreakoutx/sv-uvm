		Description:   	These are files which are used by the testcase
		
test.ralf       :   RALF file describing the RAL model
test.c          :   C code using RAL-C API to access RAL model defined in RALF file
dpi_tasks_sv.h  :   SV functions used in RAL-C API's definition

		Additional setup: 
 
 To run the example:

       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
