		Title: 		 VMM_TLM test for sockets
 
		Objective:     Usage of OSCI's TLM like sockets in VMM.

		Description:   This test shows the usage of initiator and target sockets. Example uses vmm_tlm_simple_initiator_socket and vmm_tlm_simple_target_socket as always @ (negedge clk interface between the xactors.

		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
