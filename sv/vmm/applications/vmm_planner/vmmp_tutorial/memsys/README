Please follow the steps below to do this section of the lab
step1:  cd test/
step2:  create memsys_test.v to do the following tasks. 
        1) init_ports() and reset_sequence(): initialization of ports and reset sequence
        2) readOP() and writeOP(): to drive read and write operations similar to those in cntrlr.
        3) use fork/join to spawn a series of read and write request to memory system with random addresses and data and test the system
        4) implement CPU class and do read/write/randomization through objects
        5) modify the fork/join so that the read/write process are synchronized using semaphores and mailboxes 
step4:  compile and run the simulation
