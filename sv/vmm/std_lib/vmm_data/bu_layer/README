Technical content:
		Title: 			SV VMM BUSINESS LAYER
		Objective: 		To demonstrate a business-specific layer on top of the VMM base classes
		Description: 	 	This is an example of a business-specific layer on top of the VMM base classes. All data and transactor models written by that business unit are then written by extending these classes, instead of extending the VMM base classes directly.
Although initially "empty", this class layer provides an opportunity for a business unit to introduce domain-specific standard functionality and best practices that can then be immediately shared by all users within that unit.
To create your own business-unit layer, simply copy the source files found in this example directory, and replace the "bu_" prefix with one that is representative of (and unique to) your organization.

		Additional setup: 	None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
