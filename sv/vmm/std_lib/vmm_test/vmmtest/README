		Title:    Usage of vmm_test to select different tests at runtime	
 
		Objective: 	Demonstrate how to use the vmm_test base class  to implement testcases and  enables runtime selection of the testcase to run on an environment. 
		Description: 	
		This example shows how to constrain some ALU transactions. These transactions, modelled by the alu_data class , are randomly generated by an instance of a vmm_atomic_gen and passed to an ALU driver using a vmm_channel.
		VMM 1.1 provides a way to include all test files in a single compilation. if any of the test in the test directory is taken, it can be seen that the vmm_test short hand macro `vmm_test_begin is used to declare the test name, the name of the vmm_env where all transactors reside (alu_env in our example) and a label that is used to tag this particular test. After this, the user can build the environment, insert the factory instance and kick off the test. Then the vmm_test short hand macro `vmm_test_end is used to terminate this test declaration.
		other tests with variations in constraints can be written in the same way. Since the environment is exposed after the `vmm_test_begin short hand macro, it is possible to register callbacks, replace generators or do any other operation which is traditionally done in the VMM program block. An important aspect of these tests is that whenever they are included, they become statically declared and visible to the environment.
		Running a specific test is achieved by providing the test name on the command line, for example:

		    simv +vmm_test=test_add

			simv +vmm_test=test_sub


		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
