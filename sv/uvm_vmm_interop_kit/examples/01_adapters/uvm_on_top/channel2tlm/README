		Title:    Connecting VMM producer to a UVM consumer
 
		Objective: This example uses an <avt_channel2uvm_tlm> to connect an VMM producer (generator) to an UVM consumer.	

		Description:  With this adapter, any VMM producer using a vmm_channel to inject transactions can be connected to any UVM consumer that uses TLM port and exports.

	
		Additional setup: None	
 
 To run the example:
      Using Makefile:
       	clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
       	comp            -- To compile the design
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh       -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh        -- To compile the design
        run.csh         -- To run the design
