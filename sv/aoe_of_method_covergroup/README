		Title: 			Aspect Extension (AOE) of method and coverage group
 
		Objective: 		To Demonstrate how to use Aspect Extension class method and coverage group
		Description: 	
					The included example performs an aspect extension of the class Transaction.  The Transaction class is extended in-place, meaning the original definition is modified to include the coverage_group.  
					A second extension is also performed adding in a new class property and an aspect extension of the display task.  
					Both task extensions show the use of advice to guide the placement of the extensions.  The testcase can be run with and with/out the extension:
					Run the testcase with the original definition of Transaction (no aspects) just run "make"
					Run the testcase with the inclusion of the aspect extension of Transaction (Note: the change in randomized values addr and data) just run "make aspect" 
					Usage notes:  The class Transaction is at the $root scope.  As such the test is compiled with the '+ntb_opts dtm' option.  The aspect is also at the $root scope (aspect extension must be at the same scope as the class).

		Additional setup: None	


 Using Makefile:
        clean           -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp            -- To compile the design
	aspect_comp     -- To compile with aspect
	aspect_run     -- To run the test for the compiled design with aspect
        run             -- To run the design
        all             -- It does all the above steps.
     Using shell scripts:
        clean.csh          -- To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
        comp.csh           -- To compile the design
	aspect_comp.csh    -- To compile with aspect
	aspect_run.csh     -- To run the test for the compiled design with aspect
        run.csh         	-- To run the design
