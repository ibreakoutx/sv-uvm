Technical content:
 Title                : PARAMETERIZED INTERFACES.
 Objective            : To illustrate how to pass parameters through interfaces.
 Description          : This example has a simple bus interface which takes parameters of address and data widths which is set to a default of 32.
 
 Additional setup     : None

Run scripts:
    Using Makefile
 clean                - To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
 comp                 - To compile the design
 run                  - To run the design
 all                  - It does all the above steps.

    Using shell scripts 
 clean.csh            - To clean up the log files and executable of previous run
 comp.csh             - To compile the design
 run.csh              - To run the design	


Additional Notes:	
The example consists of the following files.

interface.sv : This file has the Bus interface block defined with all its properties, clocking blocks and modports.

test.sv : Consists of the program block which takes an instance of the interface from the top and drives address and data variables of the interface.

top.v : Creates an instance of the test, the interface and connects a clock to them.
